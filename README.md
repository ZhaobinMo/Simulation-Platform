# Simulation-Platform
This repo is the codes for a simulation platform for the competition "Competition of Future Intellignent Transportation"(未来智能交通大赛), which was jointly held by the **School of Vehicle and Mobility**, Tsinghua University, and **Siemens** in May 2018.

The simulation platform is for the contestants to verify their algorihm virtually, before using the real competition toy cars.
The platform is illustrated in the animation below, where the dots represent cars and edges represent roads.
